# Laundry Legends — Development Log

Chronological record of meaningful events, decisions, bugs, fixes, checks, and milestones. A feature is marked **verified** only when the evidence exists.

## 2026-10-19 — Phase 0 bootstrap

**Phase:** 0 — Project bootstrap
**Run:** `2026-10-19-bootstrap`
**Status:** Complete (machine-verified; human review recommended)

### Environment verified

- Workspace was empty before bootstrap; no user files were present.
- OpenCode CLI `2.0.28`; background server reported `2.0.32`.
- Current primary model: `opencode/deepseek-v4.1-flash-free`; provider catalog verified through the model tool.
- Git `2.55.0.windows.3`; Git LFS `3.7.1`; .NET SDK `10.0.401`; Node `24.21.0`; npm `11.19.0`; Python `3.15.0`.
- Unity Hub `43.5.0`.
- Unity editors installed: `6000.0.0f1`, `6000.0.64f1`, `6000.5.7f1`.
- Selected editor: `6000.0.64f1` (Unity 6.0 LTS), with Windows standalone playback engine installed.
- Unity entitlement license file exists; batch-mode launch not yet tested.
- No Blender, FFmpeg, ImageMagick, or GitHub CLI on `PATH`.
- No dedicated image, 3D, audio, or voice-generation tool verified.
- No MCP servers or plugins configured in the global OpenCode config.
- The global OpenCode config defaults to `ollama/qwen3.5:4b`; the project config selects the verified DeepSeek model. No credentials were read or exposed.

### Decisions

- **Unity 6.0 LTS / Built-In Render Pipeline.** Rationale: installed, supported, Windows module present, simpler for a small stylized 3D game, no new pipeline dependency. See `.orchestrator/decisions/0001-unity-version-and-render-pipeline.md`.
- **Legacy Input Manager initially.** Avoid a package change before it is justified.
- **Laundry loop before arcade systems.** The secret arcade remains the central progression hook, but the first playable must be the laundry loop.
- **Single `main` branch, local checkpoints, no remote yet.** Destructive Git operations and pushes are blocked/approval-gated.
- **Project-local OpenCode agents and commands.** Lead is built-in `build`; specialists are `ll-unity-dev`, `ll-designer`, `ll-reviewer`, and `ll-qa`.
- **Persistent state is split between human-readable Markdown and machine-readable JSON.** No database or service.

### Created

- Root documentation: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `MASTER_CONTEXT.md`, `GAME_DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`, `AGENT_GUIDE.md`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`, `YOUTUBE_LOG.md`, `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
- `.opencode/opencode.json`, four subagents, and ten slash commands.
- `.orchestrator/` state, budgets, task definitions, decision records, reports, and recovery guide.
- `.gitignore`, `tools/validate-bootstrap.ps1`, `tools/status.ps1`.
- Empty `ArtSource/`, `Builds/`, `TestResults/` directories with markers.

### Checks performed

- `git init -b main`; local `core.autocrlf=false` and `core.safecrlf=false`.
- JSON/frontmatter/command/document structural validation via `tools/validate-bootstrap.ps1` (result recorded in the bootstrap report).
- Git status/ignore audit before checkpoint.
- No Unity compile, Unity test, scene, gameplay, build, or playtest was run because no Unity project exists.

### Not performed / limitations

- Unity batch-mode licensing and project creation.
- Any C# compilation or Unity test.
- Any visual, audio, gameplay, performance, or build verification.
- Any asset creation or integration.
- Any external publishing or remote push.

### Git

- Initial branch: `main`.
- Baseline commit: `b78218cccfeea741d3d227ffa95e679e9ba92a72` (`chore: bootstrap Laundry Legends development system`).
- Bootstrap checkpoint tag: `bootstrap-v0.1` on the state-record commit.
- Post-checkpoint validation confirms the tag points at `HEAD` and the working tree is clean.

### Independent review

A read-only subagent reviewed the bootstrap before the checkpoint. It found pre-checkpoint completion overclaims, Git-write exposure for built-in subagents, a designer permission that was too broad, a QA task scope mismatch, a test-folder inconsistency, and two documentation contradictions. These were corrected before the checkpoint. The final post-checkpoint validation is recorded in the bootstrap run report.

### Next

`LL-P1-001` — create and validate the Unity 6.0 LTS project at the repository root, preserving bootstrap files, then verify the editor log before relying on batch-mode automation.
